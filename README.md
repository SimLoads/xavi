## Xavi is currently in development. Please check back later!

Welcome to Xavi!
Please ensure you use the installer (ScriptSetup.py) to install Xavi properly.  
That tool will ensure all the required files are downloaded and put in the right place.  

Xavi makes use of and can download [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) by itself, as well as the following packages:  
[Six](https://pypi.org/project/six/#files)  
[Pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/)  
[Libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)  
[Freetype](https://www.freetype.org/)  
[Kiwisolver](https://pypi.org/project/kiwisolver/)  
[Dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/)  
[Cycler](https://pypi.org/project/Cycler/)  

Use ScriptSetup or, for a more graphical feel, XaviInstaller to ensure these are set up correctly.
